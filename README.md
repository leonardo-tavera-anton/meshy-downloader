## 🛠️ How it Works

The extension uses a secure multi-layer approach to handle your data:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Meshy.ai Dashboard] -->|Supabase Cookie| B(Content Script)
    B -->|Encrypted Token| C{Background Service}
    C -->|Authenticated API Call| D[Meshy V2 API]
    D -->|Task Data| E(Popup UI)
    E -->|User Click| F[Native Download Manager]
    F -->|Organized Storage| G[/Downloads/meshy_models/]
```

### Technical Stack
- **Manifest V3**: Compliant with the latest Chrome extension standards.
- **Chrome Storage API**: Securely holds session data locally.
- **Native Decryption**: Handles proprietary Meshy file formats on-the-fly.

## 🔄 Conversion .meshy → .glb

Meshy.ai uses a proprietary `.meshy` format for its latest models. This extension includes a **Native Decryption Engine** that handles this format automatically.

### How it works:
1.  **Detection**: The extension identifies if a model is stored in the encrypted `.meshy` format.
2.  **Native Bridge**: It securely interfaces with Meshy's own decryption worker (`loader-worker.js`) directly within your browser tab.
3.  **Real-time Decryption**: The `.meshy` file is processed through the site's WASM module to reconstruct the original `.glb` data.
4.  **Automatic Export**: The resulting GLB is then triggered as a standard download, ensuring you get the highest quality model compatible with Blender, Unity, and Unreal Engine.

> [!NOTE]
> This process happens entirely in your browser. No data is decrypted on external servers, ensuring your 3D models remain private.

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

We take your data seriously.
*   ✅ **100% Local**: No data is ever sent to external servers. Your token stays on your machine.
*   ✅ **No Background Tracking**: The extension only activates when you open the popup.
*   ✅ **Transparent Code**: Being open-source, you can audit every line of code.
